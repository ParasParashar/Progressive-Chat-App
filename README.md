# ðŸš€ Scalable and High-Performance Chat Application

## Hey Guys! 
This is the best project in terms of scalability and performance, built to handle real-time messaging with efficiency and robustness. Whether you're chatting one-on-one or in groups, this app ensures fast delivery and seamless communication.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant delivery of messages, even under high load.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale horizontally with ease, handling thousands of concurrent users.
- **High Throughput**: Optimized for high message throughput using Kafka.
- **Reliability**: Ensures message delivery and integrity with robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
- **Group Messaging**: Supports group chats with all the same performance guarantees as one-to-one messaging.
- **Seen Message Status**: Real-time updates of message status (seen/unseen) for better user experience.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Server-side framework for building a fast, scalable backend.
- **Prisma ORM**: Simplifies database management and queries, providing a type-safe interface to the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable and powerful relational database for storing user data, messages, and conversations.
- **Kafka**: Distributed streaming platform used for high-throughput, real-time data pipelines and messaging.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used for caching and real-time message notifications via Pub/Sub.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- **Zustand**: State management library for React to handle global states, particularly for managing the video call state.
- **React & Vite**: Frontend framework and tooling for building a fast, interactive user interface.
- **React-query** : Data fetching library use in react vite for interacting with the backend.
- **WebRTC**: Handles peer-to-peer video calling functionality.

## ðŸš€ Why This Stack?
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, ideal for real-time applications.
- **Prisma ORM**: Provides a high level of abstraction, type safety, and easy database migration management, making it perfect for complex relational data models.
- **PostgreSQL**: Known for its reliability, PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and supports complex queries needed for messaging systems.
- **Kafka**: Used for its ability to handle large streams of data with low latency, making it the backbone of the messaging pipeline.
- **Redis**: Employed for its speed and simplicity, Redis is perfect for caching and Pub/Sub scenarios, ensuring real-time updates and notifications.
- **Socket.IO**: Offers real-time communication capabilities, essential for live messaging and notification systems.
- **React & Vite**: Ensures a fast, responsive, and interactive user interface with modern frontend development practices.
- **WebRTC**: Facilitates peer-to-peer video calls, adding a layer of interactivity to the chat application.
- **React-query**: It helps in  manage state and fetch data in this. It can automatically refetch data and update the UI, so users always have access to latest information.
- **Zustand**: Simplifies state management in complex applications like video calls, keeping the frontend responsive and efficient.
